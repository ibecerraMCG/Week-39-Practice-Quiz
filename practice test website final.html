            // --- Paste the 30 question objects here ---
             // Question 1
            {
                question: "A 32-year-old man presents to the clinic with a 4-day history of progressive weakness in his extremities. He recently recovered from an upper respiratory tract infection. On physical examination, he has symmetric weakness affecting both proximal and distal muscles, absent deep tendon reflexes, and intact sensation. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition?",
                options: {
                    A: "Autoimmune reaction triggered by infection",
                    B: "Insufficient migration of neural crest cells during embryogenesis",
                    C: "Failure of myelin sheath formation in the spinal cord",
                    D: "Disruption of signaling between pharyngeal endoderm and neural crest cells",
                    E: "Accumulation of methylmalonic acid due to vitamin deficiency"
                },
                correctAnswer: "A",
                rationale: "The vignette describes symptoms consistent with Guillain-Barré syndrome. While not explicitly detailed, Slide 12 in the 'Development of the Pharyngeal Arches' mentions GBS as an option in a vignette testing application of knowledge, suggesting it's a known condition. However, the other options directly relate to specific embryological or nutritional deficiencies discussed in the other slides (neural crest cell migration, myelin sheath issues related to B12 deficiency, pharyngeal arch signaling issues). Although the mechanism of GBS isn't deeply covered, the pattern recognition of the vignette's symptoms (progressive weakness after infection, absent reflexes) points to a likely autoimmune/post-infectious neuropathy process, contrasting with the specific developmental/nutritional causes offered as distractors based on other slides. Given the NBME style emphasizes application, recognizing the symptom pattern as distinct from specific congenital causes from other slides is key."
            },
            // Question 2
             {
                 question: "A 5-year-old boy is brought to the pediatrician due to worsening pain and fatigue over the past few weeks. On physical examination, he appears pale and malnourished, with pinpoint hemorrhages on his skin and swollen, bleeding gums. His diet consists primarily of processed foods. Deficiency of which of the following vitamins is most likely contributing to this patient's clinical presentation?",
                 options: {
                     A: "Vitamin B1",
                     B: "Vitamin B6",
                     C: "Vitamin B9",
                     D: "Vitamin B12",
                     E: "Vitamin C"
                 },
                 correctAnswer: "E",
                 rationale: "The patient presents with symptoms consistent with scurvy (fatigue, pale appearance, pinpoint hemorrhages/petechiae, swollen/bleeding gums). Scurvy is caused by Vitamin C deficiency. The vignette highlights poor diet as a risk factor. Vitamin C is an antioxidant and crucial for collagen synthesis; deficiency leads to weakened connective tissue (slide 29, Water Soluble Vitamins). Deficiencies of B1, B6, B9, and B12 cause different symptom profiles (beriberi, neurological/heme synthesis issues, megaloblastic anemia, etc.)."
             },
             // Question 3
             {
                 question: "A 3-day-old male newborn develops excessive drooling and is unable to feed without immediate regurgitation. Attempts to pass a nasogastric tube are unsuccessful. The mother had polyhydramnios during pregnancy. Which of the following is the most likely embryological basis for this newborn's condition?",
                 options: {
                     A: "Failure of recanalization of the duodenum",
                     B: "Incomplete partitioning of the foregut by the tracheoesophageal septum",
                     C: "Abnormal migration of neural crest cells into the hindgut wall",
                     D: "Incomplete rotation of the stomach during development",
                     E: "Persistence of the thyroglossal duct"
                 },
                 correctAnswer: "B",
                 rationale: "The symptoms (excessive drooling, inability to feed, immediate regurgitation, inability to pass NG tube) and maternal history (polyhydramnios) are classic for esophageal atresia. Slide 11 in 'Development of the Gastrointestinal System' states that esophageal atresia results from failure of the foregut to partition completely into the esophagus and trachea by the tracheoesophageal septum. Option A relates to duodenal atresia (Slide 20, GI Dev), C relates to Hirschsprung's (Slide 52, GI Pathology), D relates to pyloric stenosis or malrotation (Slide 14, GI Dev; Slide 42, GI Dev), and E relates to thyroglossal duct cysts (Slide 41, GI Dev)."
             },
             // Question 4
             {
                 question: "A 68-year-old woman with a history of severe cardiac disease presents with sudden onset of severe abdominal pain, disproportionate to physical exam findings. She develops bloody diarrhea and signs of shock. Surgery reveals hemorrhagic infarction of the small bowel. Occlusion of which of the following arteries is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?",
                 options: {
                     A: "Celiac trunk",
                     B: "Superior mesenteric artery",
                     C: "Inferior mesenteric artery",
                     D: "Right colic artery",
                     E: "Marginal artery"
                 },
                 correctAnswer: "B",
                 rationale: "Sudden, severe abdominal pain out of proportion to exam, bloody diarrhea, and shock in a patient with risk factors for vascular disease (cardiac disease) is highly suggestive of acute mesenteric ischemia leading to small bowel infarction. Slide 11 in 'Lower GI Pathology' shows a specimen of small bowel infarction due to a thrombosed superior mesenteric artery (SMA). The SMA supplies the midgut, including most of the small intestine (duodenum distal to bile duct, jejunum, ileum) (Slide 32, GI Dev; Slide 7, GI Dev; Slide 2, Superior/Inferior Mesenteric Arteries). The celiac trunk supplies the foregut (Slide 7, GI Dev), the IMA supplies the hindgut (Slide 7, GI Dev), the right colic artery is a branch of the SMA supplying the ascending colon (Slide 4, Superior/Inferior Mesenteric Arteries), and the marginal artery provides collateral circulation (Slide 7, Superior/Inferior Mesenteric Arteries)."
             },
             // Question 5
             {
                 question: "A 4-year-old presents with fever, abdominal cramps, and watery diarrhea. His symptoms began 12 hours after attending a family picnic where he ate fried rice. Vomiting is not a prominent symptom. Which of the following pathogens is the most likely cause of this patient's illness?",
                 options: {
                     A: "Vibrio cholerae",
                     B: "Clostridium perfringens",
                     C: "Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC)",
                     D: "Shigella sonnei",
                     E: "Bacillus cereus"
                 },
                 correctAnswer: "E",
                 rationale: "The vignette describes watery diarrhea with a relatively short incubation period (12 hours) after eating fried rice. Slide 15 in 'Bacterial Infections' lists Bacillus cereus as a cause of watery diarrhea associated with fried rice ingestion, often due to a pre-formed toxin causing symptoms within 2-6 hours. While other options can cause watery diarrhea, the association with fried rice and the incubation period strongly point to B. cereus. C. perfringens also produces a toxin causing diarrhea, but is often linked to cooked meats (Slide 16, Bacterial Infections). ETEC is a common cause of traveler's diarrhea, but the fried rice link is stronger for B. cereus (Slide 11, Bacterial Infections). Shigella causes dysentery (bloody diarrhea) (Slide 29, Bacterial Infections). Vibrio cholerae causes severe watery diarrhea but is linked to contaminated water or seafood (Slide 7, Bacterial Infections)."
             },
             // Question 6
             {
                 question: "A 32-year-old woman, recently treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for pneumonia, develops severe, watery diarrhea. Flexible sigmoidoscopy shows pseudomembranes in the colon. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism by which the causative pathogen produces disease in this patient?",
                 options: {
                     A: "Inhibition of host cell protein synthesis",
                     B: "Disruption of actin cytoskeleton via glycosylation and inactivation of Rho B",
                     C: "Hyperactivation of host adenylate cyclase leading to increased fluid secretion",
                     D: "Invasion and destruction of intestinal epithelial cells",
                     E: "Stimulation of guanylyl cyclase leading to decreased sodium absorption"
                 },
                 correctAnswer: "B",
                 rationale: "The clinical presentation (diarrhea after antibiotics, pseudomembranes) is classic for Clostridium difficile infection. Slide 19 in 'Bacterial Infections' describes C. difficile pathogenesis, noting that its toxins (TcdA, TcdB) disrupt the actin cytoskeleton by glycosylating and inactivating Rho B guanosine triphosphatases, leading to disrupted barrier function and apoptosis. Option A relates to Shiga toxin (though not the primary mechanism listed for C. diff toxins). Option C relates to Cholera toxin and ETEC LT toxin (Slide 8, Slide 12 Bacterial Infections). Option D relates to invasive pathogens causing dysentery (e.g., Shigella, EIEC) (Slide 30, Bacterial Infections). Option E relates to ETEC ST toxin (Slide 13, Bacterial Infections)."
             },
             // Question 7
             {
                 question: "A 15-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with a 6-hour history of cramping periumbilical pain that has shifted to the right lower abdominal quadrant and is now constant and more severe. He has vomited several times and has a fever. Physical examination shows tenderness and guarding in the right lower quadrant. Lab work shows an elevated white blood cell count. Which of the following best describes the likely mechanism of pain in this patient?",

Slide 52 in 'Superior and Inferior Mesenteric Arteries' (and Slide 27, Lower GI Pathology) explains that the initial periumbilical pain is visceral, carried by visceral afferent fibers following sympathetic nerves back to spinal cord level T10. As inflammation progresses and irritates the parietal peritoneum in the RLQ, sharp, localized pain is carried by parietal somatic fibers innervating the abdominal wall. Option B describes hindgut parasympathetic afferents (rectum). Options C and E misattribute somatic fibers to the initial visceral pain or hindgut innervation patterns.

Slide 31 in 'Small Bowel Disorders II' (Patient 1 Take Home Message) explicitly states B12 deficiency and fatty acid/bile salt malabsorption due to loss of absorptive surface from terminal ileum resection (in the context of Crohn's). Slide 39 in 'Small Bowel Disorders II' shows bile salt loss and steatorrhea after small bowel resection. Option A relates to pernicious anemia or gastrectomy, not terminal ileum issues. Option C relates to Hirschsprung's. Option D relates to Celiac disease affecting the duodenum. Option E relates to pancreatic insufficiency."

                 question: "A histology slide shows simple columnar epithelium of the large intestine with numerous goblet cells and columnar absorptive cells, but notably lacking villi. Which of the following layers is immediately deep to this epithelium and contains blood vessels, nerves, and lymphatics?",
                 options: {

                 },
                 correctAnswer: "E",
                 rationale: "The vignette describes the epithelium of the large intestine (simple columnar, goblet and absorptive cells, lacks villi - Slide 27, Lower GI Histology). The question asks for the layer immediately deep to the epithelium containing blood vessels, nerves, and lymphatics. Slide 30 in 'Lower GI Histology' shows the histology of the large intestine, indicating the Lamina propria is directly beneath the epithelium and contains blood and lymph capillaries, nerve fibers, and diffuse lymph tissue. The submucosa (Option B) is deeper than the lamina propria. Muscularis mucosa (Option A) is a muscle layer within the mucosa (epithelium + lamina propria + muscularis mucosa), but the primary neurovascular supply is in the lamina propria and submucosa. Muscularis externa (Option C) and Serosa (Option D) are outside the submucosa."

             {
                 question: "A 70-year-old man presents with signs and symptoms consistent with megaloblastic anemia. Lab tests reveal low serum vitamin B12 and elevated serum methylmalonic acid levels. He denies strict vegetarianism. He is diagnosed with pernicious anemia. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's vitamin deficiency?",
                 options: {
                     A: "Inadequate dietary intake",

                     D: "Failure of intestinal absorption due to extensive ileal resection",
                     E: "Drug-induced inactivation of vitamin B12"
                 },
                 correctAnswer: "C",
                 rationale: "The vignette describes megaloblastic anemia with specific lab findings (low B12, high MMA - distinguishes from folate deficiency) and a diagnosis of pernicious anemia. Slide 19 in 'Water Soluble Vitamins' states that pernicious anemia is the most frequent cause of severe B12 deficiency and is due to autoimmune destruction of gastric parietal cells and/or intrinsic factor, which is necessary for B12 absorption. While options B and D can cause B12 malabsorption, they are not the direct cause of pernicious anemia specifically. Option A is less likely given the lab findings and lack of strict vegetarianism. Option E is not listed as a primary cause of pernicious anemia."

             {
                 question: "A histology slide shows the junction between simple columnar epithelium and stratified squamous epithelium, associated with a transition in muscular layers. Which of the following anatomical locations is most likely being examined?",

                 },
                 correctAnswer: "D",
                 rationale: "The vignette describes a transition from simple columnar to stratified squamous epithelium. Slide 37 in 'Lower GI Histology' shows the Rectoanal Junction as the site where the simple columnar mucosal lining of the rectum is replaced by stratified squamous epithelium of the anal canal. Other options represent transitions between different parts of the GI tract but not this specific epithelial change. The esophagogastric junction transitions from stratified squamous (esophagus) to simple columnar (stomach), but the question describes the reverse and specific layers/muscular changes. The duodenojejunal and ileocecal junctions are within the simple columnar epithelium of the small and large intestines. The external anal sphincter is a muscular structure, not an epithelial junction."

                 question: "A 12-month-old previously healthy infant did not have a bowel movement for one day. Her abdomen is distended and tender to palpation with absent bowel sounds. Plain abdominal films show distended loops of small bowel with many air-fluid levels. Which of the following is the most likely etiology?",
                 options: {

                 },
                 correctAnswer: "B",
                 rationale: "The vignette describes an infant with acute symptoms of bowel obstruction (abdominal distention, absent bowel sounds, air-fluid levels on X-ray) after being previously healthy. In this age group, intussusception is a common cause of acute obstruction. Slide 8 in 'Lower GI Pathology' describes intussusception as telescoping of bowel causing obstruction, and the question presents features consistent with this. Pyloric stenosis (option A) presents with projectile vomiting, typically younger infants. Hirschsprung disease (option C) is congenital megacolon due to failed neural crest migration, typically presenting with failure to pass meconium in newborns. Duodenal atresia (option D) presents with bilious vomiting and a double bubble sign, typically in newborns. Celiac disease (option E) is a malabsorption disorder, not acute obstruction."

                 question: "A 28-year-old woman with a history of ulcerative colitis involving her entire colon for 10 years is undergoing a surveillance colonoscopy. Biopsies from flat colonic mucosa reveal abnormal glandular architecture, nuclear hyperchromasia, and loss of polarity. This patient is at increased risk for which of the following?",

                 },
                 correctAnswer: "D",
                 rationale: "The vignette describes a patient with long-standing, extensive ulcerative colitis undergoing surveillance. The biopsy findings (abnormal glandular architecture, nuclear changes, loss of polarity) are characteristic of dysplasia, which is a precursor to colorectal carcinoma in IBD. Slide 35 in 'Lower GI Pathology' states that both Crohn and Ulcerative Colitis patients are at risk for developing neoplasia, with risk factors including long duration and pancolitis, and notes that IBD-associated dysplasia precedes adenocarcinoma. Pseudopolyps and toxic megacolon (options A and B) are complications of active UC, but not the malignant transformation indicated by the biopsy. Ulcerative jejunitis (option C) is a complication of refractory celiac disease or Crohn's, not UC. Primary sclerosing cholangitis (option E) is an associated condition of UC, not a risk directly indicated by these biopsy findings."

                 question: "A histology slide from the appendix shows abundant lymphoid nodules in the mucosa and submucosa. Which of the following is the primary function of the appendix based on this histological feature?",
                 options: {
                     A: "Absorption of electrolytes and water",

                 correctAnswer: "D",
                 rationale: "The vignette describes the prominent lymphoid tissue in the appendix. While the appendix has immune function, the specific function emphasized in the provided materials related to its lymphoid tissue is housing beneficial bacteria. Slide 4 in 'Superior and Inferior Mesenteric Arteries' (and Slide 26, Lower GI Histology) describes the function of the appendix as housing good bacteria for re-colonization of gut flora. Absorption (option A) is a function of the large intestine generally. Secretion of alkaline mucus (option B) is a function of duodenal Brunner's glands. Production of digestive enzymes (option C) is primarily by the pancreas and small intestinal enterocytes. Antigen transport (option E) is a function of M-cells, typically in Peyer's patches, though M-cells are associated with lymphoid tissue. The lymphoid tissue in the appendix is related to immune function, but the primary listed function is bacterial reservoir."

Surgical exploration reveals abdominal contents herniated into the umbilical cord, contained within a sac of peritoneum and umbilical cord epithelium. Which of the following is the most likely embryological cause of this condition?",

                 rationale: "The vignette describes abdominal contents herniated into the umbilical cord, contained within a sac. This is the definition of an omphalocele. Slide 39 in 'Development of the Gastrointestinal System' (and Slide 60, GI Dev Text) states that an omphalocele is caused by failure of the intestine to return to the abdominal cavity after the normal physiological umbilical herniation around week 10. Option A relates to gastroschisis (contents extrude directly into amniotic cavity, usually lateral to umbilicus, not in a sac). Option C relates to malrotation/volvulus. Option D relates to Hirschsprung's. Option E relates to Meckel's diverticulum."

Slide 20 explicitly states that this mucus is alkaline and neutralizes chyme entering the duodenum, making the contents less acidic for pancreatic enzyme action. Protein digestion (option A) is initiated in the stomach (pepsin) and completed in the small intestine lumen/brush border. Fat absorption (option B) involves bile salts and enterocytes. Innate immunity (option D) is primarily associated with Paneth cells. Intestinal peristalsis (option E) is controlled by smooth muscle layers and the myenteric plexus."
